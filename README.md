# **Portfolio**

## **Welcome**
**The portfolio you see before you is based entirely on HTML/CSS. This portfolio serves as a temporary stand point in order to showcase some of my work that i am personally proud of. Coding is a forever journey of learning. My programming experience began April 26, 2021. Prior to that date i had zero coding to my name. I will showcase some of my proudest works. And mind you ZERO PRIOR experience. The Minecraft Memory Game that i built using JavaScript and some CSS/HTML is honestly my favorite thing i have ever built. I hope you enjoy my portfolio. If you see anything please feel free to contact me and lets connect.**
